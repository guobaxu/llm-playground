Only literal extraction.**\n\n## 6. `refs`\n- A list of compound identifiers (e.g., \"Compound 1\", \"Intermediate A\") referenced as precursors, reagents, or intermediates in this step.\n- Only exact, formal identifiers as found in the text.\n- Never include chemical names, structures, or SMILES.\n- If no previous compounds are referenced, set to `null` (do not use an empty list).\n\n---\n\n# Output Format\n\nWrap all steps in a single JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"compound_id\": \"...\",\n      \"iupac_name\": \"...\",\n      \"structure_id\": \"...\",\n      \"detail_ids\": [\"...\", ...],\n      \"detail\": \"...\",\n      \"refs\": [...] or null\n    },\n    { ... }\n  ]\n}\n```\nField order and structure must be strictly followed.\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Rules\n\n1.

Never combine steps—always split at clearly marked \"Step\" boundaries or by explicit process transitions.\n\n4. No cross-step inference—never borrow, infer, or synthesize data from other steps or context.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n  - If no explicit step labels, split based on clear process boundaries (e.g., “Then was added…”).\n  - If only a chemical name is present for the product (no identifier), set compound_id to \"\", use the name.\n  - For refs, only include labels for compounds explicitly referenced as reactants, intermediates, or reagents.\n\n6.

To the solution was added isopropylmagnesium chloride (2 M solution in THF)(1.8 ml, 3.7 mmol) dropwise at 60°C. The solution was stirred for 1 minute.Then, to the solution was added bis(methylthio)copper(III) bromide (83 mg, 0.350 mmol) (copper bromide dimethylsulfide complex) as a solid at once. The solution was stirred at rt for 5 min. Then, to a dry 50 mL rb flask equipped with a stir bar and placed under N2 atm was added THF (9 ml) and isopropyl 2-chloro-2-oxoacetate (580 mg,3.85 mmol). The flask was placed in a -78 °C bath and was stirred for 10 min. To the flask was added the organometallic suspension/solution prepared above via addition funnel. The mixture remained a suspension of fine black precipitate and a pale orange solution. The bath was allowed to warm to rt with stirring. LCMS analysis after 1.5h found a peak with the expected product mass. Then,to the reaction mixture was added diethanolamine (403 ul, 4.21 mmol,(the diethanolamine is expected to coordinate both the Cu and the Mg) The mixture was transfered to a separatory funnel using water and Et2O. The mixture was diluted with water and was extracted with Et2O. The combined organics were washed with brine; dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. The solution was concentraed in vacuo.

Your job is to extract **each synthesis step** from chemical patent text, with strict adherence to original structure and wording, and no cross-step inference. Follow the rules below carefully.\n\n---\n\n# Background\n\nThe input consists of patent text converted from PDF, marked with explicit region tags:\n- <text id=page###.id##> … </text>: OCR'd paragraph, sentence, or bullet.\n- <mol id=page###.id##> … </mol>: One molecular structure, with an ID.\n- <table id=page###.id###> … </table>: Markdown-format table data.\n- <scheme id=page###.id##> … </scheme>: Synthesis route image as Markdown table.\n\n**Tags are always top-level, never nested, and maintain page order. All IDs must be preserved exactly as in the source.**\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Task\n\nExtract **every synthesis step** as a separate record (never group multiple steps together), regardless of how compounds or examples are organized in the patent.\nFor each step, extract these fields:\n---\n\n## 1. `compound_id`\n- The identifier of the **final product of this synthesis step** (e.g., \"Compound 2\", \"Intermediate B\").\n- For a sub-step product without an explicit identifier but within a section title, construct the compound_id as:  `[Section Title].[Sub-step Label]`  \n  E.g., \"Example 5.Step 2\" (use original wording for both section and sub-step).\n- If the step **explicitly names** the product (e.g., \"to give Compound 4\", \"affording Intermediate B\"), use that exact label.\n- If this is the **final product-forming step** under a section title (like \"Example 5\", \"Compound 3\", \"Preparation 2\") and the product is not otherwise named, assign the section title as the `compound_id`.\n- Only the last step in such a section may receive the section title as `compound_id`.\n- If the step is not within any titled section and lacks a product identifier, set `compound_id` to \"\".\n\n\n## 2. `iupac_name`\n- The IUPAC name of the product synthesized in this step.\n- If it is explicitly stated in the step heading or text, use it.\n- If not, and this is the final product and referred to as \"the title compound,\" you may use the title IUPAC name if it exist.\n- Otherwise, set to \"\".\n- **Never infer, summarize, or fabricate names based on other steps or reagents.**\n\n## 3. `structure_id`\n- Only assign a structure_id if a <mol> tag is present and represents the final product of the entire Example/Section (not for every intermediate or step product).\n- Most steps will have structure_id: \"\".\n- If a structure drawing is given, link its ID only to the last product-forming step in that Example/Section.\n- Never infer or fabricate a structure_id.\n\n\n## 4. `detail_ids`\n- An ordered list of `<text id=...>` blocks containing the synthesis procedure for this step.\n- Include only blocks describing the actual experimental procedure for this step.\n- Do not include analytical data unless mixed with procedural text.\n- Each ID must point to a complete block.\n\n## 5. `detail`\n- Concatenate, in order, the verbatim text of all blocks listed in `detail_ids`.\n- A thorough and continuous text describing the synthesis steps, conditions, observations, and any relevant analytical data (e.g., NMR, LCMS) for the compound.\n- **No paraphrasing or summarization. Only literal extraction.**\n\n## 6. `refs`\n- A list of compound identifiers (e.g., \"Compound 1\", \"Intermediate A\") referenced as precursors, reagents, or intermediates in this step.\n- Only exact, formal identifiers as found in the text.\n- Never include chemical names, structures, or SMILES.\n- If no previous compounds are referenced, set to `null` (do not use an empty list).\n\n---\n\n# Output Format\n\nWrap all steps in a single JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"compound_id\": \"...\",\n      \"iupac_name\": \"...\",\n      \"structure_id\": \"...\",\n      \"detail_ids\": [\"...\", ...],\n      \"detail\": \"...\",\n      \"refs\": [...] or null\n    },\n    { ... }\n  ]\n}\n```\nField order and structure must be strictly followed.\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Rules\n\n1. One record per synthesis step—even if steps are within a single Example/Compound section.\n\n2. Support all text formats, including:\n  - Compound ID + structure + IUPAC name + procedure\n  - Compound ID + route diagram + multi-step synthesis\n  - Only IUPAC name + procedure\n  - IUPAC name + structure + procedure\n  - Numbered steps within an Example\n  - Long, unsegmented procedural blocks (treat as one step if only one product is described)\n\n3. Never combine steps—always split at clearly marked \"Step\" boundaries or by explicit process transitions.\n\n4. No cross-step inference—never borrow, infer, or synthesize data from other steps or context.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n  - If no explicit step labels, split based on clear process boundaries (e.g., “Then was added…”).\n  - If only a chemical name is present for the product (no identifier), set compound_id to \"\", use the name.\n  - For refs, only include labels for compounds explicitly referenced as reactants, intermediates, or reagents.\n\n6. Indirect Naming:\n - Accept references like \"the title compound\", \"the desired product\", \"the compound obtained in Step 2\" as meaning the current product but do NOT use them as compound_id or iupac_name.\n - Use section titles as compound_id only when rules above apply.\n\n7. Multiple Steps under One Example:\n - Each step must be separate.\n - Only the final step in the section can take the section title as compound_id.\n - Intermediate steps: assign compound_id as per the above rules.\n"
