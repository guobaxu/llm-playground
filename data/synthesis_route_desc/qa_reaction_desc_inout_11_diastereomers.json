Your job is to extract **each synthesis step** from chemical patent text, with strict adherence to original structure and wording, and no cross-step inference. Follow the rules below carefully.\n\n---\n\n# Background\n\nThe input consists of patent text converted from PDF, marked with explicit region tags:\n- <text id=page###.id##> … </text>: OCR'd paragraph, sentence, or bullet.\n- <mol id=page###.id##> … </mol>: One molecular structure, with an ID.\n- <table id=page###.id###> … </table>: Markdown-format table data.\n- <scheme id=page###.id##> … </scheme>: Synthesis route image as Markdown table.\n\n**Tags are always top-level, never nested, and maintain page order. All IDs must be preserved exactly as in the source.**\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Task\n\nExtract **every synthesis step** as a separate record (never group multiple steps together), regardless of how compounds or examples are organized in the patent.\nFor each step, extract these fields:\n---\n\n## 1. `compound_id`\n- The identifier of the **final product of this synthesis step** (e.g., \"Compound 2\", \"Intermediate B\").\n- For a sub-step product without an explicit identifier but within a section title, construct the compound_id as:  `[Section Title].[Sub-step Label]`  \n  E.g., \"Example 5.Step 2\" (use original wording for both section and sub-step).\n- If the step **explicitly names** the product (e.g., \"to give Compound 4\", \"affording Intermediate B\"), use that exact label.\n- If this is the **final product-forming step** under a section title (like \"Example 5\", \"Compound 3\", \"Preparation 2\") and the product is not otherwise named, assign the section title as the `compound_id`.\n- Only the last step in such a section may receive the section title as `compound_id`.\n- If the step is not within any titled section and lacks a product identifier, set `compound_id` to \"\".\n\n\n## 2. `iupac_name`\n- The IUPAC name of the product synthesized in this step.\n- If it is explicitly stated in the step heading or text, use it.\n- If not, and this is the final product and referred to as \"the title compound,\" you may use the title IUPAC name if it exist.\n- Otherwise, set to \"\".\n- **Never infer, summarize, or fabricate names based on other steps or reagents.**\n\n## 3. `structure_id`\n- Only assign a structure_id if a <mol> tag is present and represents the final product of the entire Example/Section (not for every intermediate or step product).\n- Most steps will have structure_id: \"\".\n- If a structure drawing is given, link its ID only to the last product-forming step in that Example/Section.\n- Never infer or fabricate a structure_id.\n\n\n## 4. `detail_ids`\n- An ordered list of `<text id=...>` blocks containing the synthesis procedure for this step.\n- Include only blocks describing the actual experimental procedure for this step.\n- Do not include analytical data unless mixed with procedural text.\n- Each ID must point to a complete block.\n\n## 5. `detail`\n- Concatenate, in order, the verbatim text of all blocks listed in `detail_ids`.\n- A thorough and continuous text describing the synthesis steps, conditions, observations, and any relevant analytical data (e.g., NMR, LCMS) for the compound.\n- **No paraphrasing or summarization. Only literal extraction.**\n\n## 6. `refs`\n- A list of compound identifiers (e.g., \"Compound 1\", \"Intermediate A\") referenced as precursors, reagents, or intermediates in this step.\n- Only exact, formal identifiers as found in the text.\n- Never include chemical names, structures, or SMILES.\n- If no previous compounds are referenced, set to `null` (do not use an empty list).\n\n---\n\n# Output Format\n\nWrap all steps in a single JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"compound_id\": \"...\",\n      \"iupac_name\": \"...\",\n      \"structure_id\": \"...\",\n      \"detail_ids\": [\"...\", ...],\n      \"detail\": \"...\",\n      \"refs\": [...] or null\n    },\n    { ... }\n  ]\n}\n```\nField order and structure must be strictly followed.\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Rules\n\n1. One record per synthesis step—even if steps are within a single Example/Compound section.\n\n2. Support all text formats, including:\n  - Compound ID + structure + IUPAC name + procedure\n  - Compound ID + route diagram + multi-step synthesis\n  - Only IUPAC name + procedure\n  - IUPAC name + structure + procedure\n  - Numbered steps within an Example\n  - Long, unsegmented procedural blocks (treat as one step if only one product is described)\n\n3. Never combine steps—always split at clearly marked \"Step\" boundaries or by explicit process transitions.\n\n4. No cross-step inference—never borrow, infer, or synthesize data from other steps or context.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n  - If no explicit step labels, split based on clear process boundaries (e.g., “Then was added…”).\n  - If only a chemical name is present for the product (no identifier), set compound_id to \"\", use the name.\n  - For refs, only include labels for compounds explicitly referenced as reactants, intermediates, or reagents.\n\n6. Indirect Naming:\n - Accept references like \"the title compound\", \"the desired product\", \"the compound obtained in Step 2\" as meaning the current product but do NOT use them as compound_id or iupac_name.\n - Use section titles as compound_id only when rules above apply.\n\n7. Multiple Steps under One Example:\n - Each step must be separate.\n - Only the final step in the section can take the section title as compound_id.\n - Intermediate steps: assign compound_id as per the above rules.\n"

Your job is to extract **each synthesis step** from chemical patent text, with strict adherence to original structure and wording, and no cross-step inference. Follow the rules below carefully.\n\n---\n\n# Background\n\nThe input consists of patent text converted from PDF, marked with explicit region tags:\n- <text id=page###.id##> … </text>: OCR'd paragraph, sentence, or bullet.\n- <mol id=page###.id##> … </mol>: One molecular structure, with an ID.\n- <table id=page###.id###> … </table>: Markdown-format table data.\n- <scheme id=page###.id##> … </scheme>: Synthesis route image as Markdown table.\n\n**Tags are always top-level, never nested, and maintain page order. All IDs must be preserved exactly as in the source.**\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Task\n\nExtract **every synthesis step** as a separate record (never group multiple steps together), regardless of how compounds or examples are organized in the patent.\nFor each step, extract these fields:\n---\n\n## 1. `compound_id`\n- The identifier of the **final product of this synthesis step** (e.g., \"Compound 2\", \"Intermediate B\").\n- For a sub-step product without an explicit identifier but within a section title, construct the compound_id as:  `[Section Title].[Sub-step Label]`  \n  E.g., \"Example 5.Step 2\" (use original wording for both section and sub-step).\n- If the step **explicitly names** the product (e.g., \"to give Compound 4\", \"affording Intermediate B\"), use that exact label.\n- If this is the **final product-forming step** under a section title (like \"Example 5\", \"Compound 3\", \"Preparation 2\") and the product is not otherwise named, assign the section title as the `compound_id`.\n- Only the last step in such a section may receive the section title as `compound_id`.\n- If the step is not within any titled section and lacks a product identifier, set `compound_id` to \"\".\n\n\n## 2. `iupac_name`\n- The IUPAC name of the product synthesized in this step.\n- If it is explicitly stated in the step heading or text, use it.\n- If not, and this is the final product and referred to as \"the title compound,\" you may use the title IUPAC name if it exist.\n- Otherwise, set to \"\".\n- **Never infer, summarize, or fabricate names based on other steps or reagents.**\n\n## 3. `structure_id`\n- Only assign a structure_id if a <mol> tag is present and represents the final product of the entire Example/Section (not for every intermediate or step product).\n- Most steps will have structure_id: \"\".\n- If a structure drawing is given, link its ID only to the last product-forming step in that Example/Section.\n- Never infer or fabricate a structure_id.\n\n\n## 4. `detail_ids`\n- An ordered list of `<text id=...>` blocks containing the synthesis procedure for this step.\n- Include only blocks describing the actual experimental procedure for this step.\n- Do not include analytical data unless mixed with procedural text.\n- Each ID must point to a complete block.\n\n## 5. `detail`\n- Concatenate, in order, the verbatim text of all blocks listed in `detail_ids`.\n- A thorough and continuous text describing the synthesis steps, conditions, observations, and any relevant analytical data (e.g., NMR, LCMS) for the compound.\n- **No paraphrasing or summarization. Only literal extraction.**\n\n## 6. `refs`\n- A list of compound identifiers (e.g., \"Compound 1\", \"Intermediate A\") referenced as precursors, reagents, or intermediates in this step.\n- Only exact, formal identifiers as found in the text.\n- Never include chemical names, structures, or SMILES.\n- If no previous compounds are referenced, set to `null` (do not use an empty list).\n\n---\n\n# Output Format\n\nWrap all steps in a single JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"compound_id\": \"...\",\n      \"iupac_name\": \"...\",\n      \"structure_id\": \"...\",\n      \"detail_ids\": [\"...\", ...],\n      \"detail\": \"...\",\n      \"refs\": [...] or null\n    },\n    { ... }\n  ]\n}\n```\nField order and structure must be strictly followed.\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Rules\n\n1. One record per synthesis step—even if steps are within a single Example/Compound section.\n\n2. Support all text formats, including:\n  - Compound ID + structure + IUPAC name + procedure\n  - Compound ID + route diagram + multi-step synthesis\n  - Only IUPAC name + procedure\n  - IUPAC name + structure + procedure\n  - Numbered steps within an Example\n  - Long, unsegmented procedural blocks (treat as one step if only one product is described)\n\n3. Never combine steps—always split at clearly marked \"Step\" boundaries or by explicit process transitions.\n\n4. No cross-step inference—never borrow, infer, or synthesize data from other steps or context.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n  - If no explicit step labels, split based on clear process boundaries (e.g., “Then was added…”).\n  - If only a chemical name is present for the product (no identifier), set compound_id to \"\", use the name.\n  - For refs, only include labels for compounds explicitly referenced as reactants, intermediates, or reagents.\n\n6. Indirect Naming:\n - Accept references like \"the title compound\", \"the desired product\", \"the compound obtained in Step 2\" as meaning the current product but do NOT use them as compound_id or iupac_name.\n - Use section titles as compound_id only when rules above apply.\n\n7. Multiple Steps under One Example:\n - Each step must be separate.\n - Only the final step in the section can take the section title as compound_id.\n - Intermediate steps: assign compound_id as per the above rules.\n"

Your job is to extract **each synthesis step** from chemical patent text, with strict adherence to original structure and wording, and no cross-step inference. Follow the rules below carefully.\n\n---\n\n# Background\n\nThe input consists of patent text converted from PDF, marked with explicit region tags:\n- <text id=page###.id##> … </text>: OCR'd paragraph, sentence, or bullet.\n- <mol id=page###.id##> … </mol>: One molecular structure, with an ID.\n- <table id=page###.id###> … </table>: Markdown-format table data.\n- <scheme id=page###.id##> … </scheme>: Synthesis route image as Markdown table.\n\n**Tags are always top-level, never nested, and maintain page order. All IDs must be preserved exactly as in the source.**\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Task\n\nExtract **every synthesis step** as a separate record (never group multiple steps together), regardless of how compounds or examples are organized in the patent.\nFor each step, extract these fields:\n---\n\n## 1. `compound_id`\n- The identifier of the **final product of this synthesis step** (e.g., \"Compound 2\", \"Intermediate B\").\n- For a sub-step product without an explicit identifier but within a section title, construct the compound_id as:  `[Section Title].[Sub-step Label]`  \n  E.g., \"Example 5.Step 2\" (use original wording for both section and sub-step).\n- If the step **explicitly names** the product (e.g., \"to give Compound 4\", \"affording Intermediate B\"), use that exact label.\n- If this is the **final product-forming step** under a section title (like \"Example 5\", \"Compound 3\", \"Preparation 2\") and the product is not otherwise named, assign the section title as the `compound_id`.\n- Only the last step in such a section may receive the section title as `compound_id`.\n- If the step is not within any titled section and lacks a product identifier, set `compound_id` to \"\".\n\n\n## 2. `iupac_name`\n- The IUPAC name of the product synthesized in this step.\n- If it is explicitly stated in the step heading or text, use it.\n- If not, and this is the final product and referred to as \"the title compound,\" you may use the title IUPAC name if it exist.\n- Otherwise, set to \"\".\n- **Never infer, summarize, or fabricate names based on other steps or reagents.**\n\n## 3. `structure_id`\n- Only assign a structure_id if a <mol> tag is present and represents the final product of the entire Example/Section (not for every intermediate or step product).\n- Most steps will have structure_id: \"\".\n- If a structure drawing is given, link its ID only to the last product-forming step in that Example/Section.\n- Never infer or fabricate a structure_id.\n\n\n## 4. `detail_ids`\n- An ordered list of `<text id=...>` blocks containing the synthesis procedure for this step.\n- Include only blocks describing the actual experimental procedure for this step.\n- Do not include analytical data unless mixed with procedural text.\n- Each ID must point to a complete block.\n\n## 5. `detail`\n- Concatenate, in order, the verbatim text of all blocks listed in `detail_ids`.\n- A thorough and continuous text describing the synthesis steps, conditions, observations, and any relevant analytical data (e.g., NMR, LCMS) for the compound.\n- **No paraphrasing or summarization. Only literal extraction.**\n\n## 6. `refs`\n- A list of compound identifiers (e.g., \"Compound 1\", \"Intermediate A\") referenced as precursors, reagents, or intermediates in this step.\n- Only exact, formal identifiers as found in the text.\n- Never include chemical names, structures, or SMILES.\n- If no previous compounds are referenced, set to `null` (do not use an empty list).\n\n---\n\n# Output Format\n\nWrap all steps in a single JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"compound_id\": \"...\",\n      \"iupac_name\": \"...\",\n      \"structure_id\": \"...\",\n      \"detail_ids\": [\"...\", ...],\n      \"detail\": \"...\",\n      \"refs\": [...] or null\n    },\n    { ... }\n  ]\n}\n```\nField order and structure must be strictly followed.\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Rules\n\n1. One record per synthesis step—even if steps are within a single Example/Compound section.\n\n2. Support all text formats, including:\n  - Compound ID + structure + IUPAC name + procedure\n  - Compound ID + route diagram + multi-step synthesis\n  - Only IUPAC name + procedure\n  - IUPAC name + structure + procedure\n  - Numbered steps within an Example\n  - Long, unsegmented procedural blocks (treat as one step if only one product is described)\n\n3. Never combine steps—always split at clearly marked \"Step\" boundaries or by explicit process transitions.\n\n4. No cross-step inference—never borrow, infer, or synthesize data from other steps or context.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n  - If no explicit step labels, split based on clear process boundaries (e.g., “Then was added…”).\n  - If only a chemical name is present for the product (no identifier), set compound_id to \"\", use the name.\n  - For refs, only include labels for compounds explicitly referenced as reactants, intermediates, or reagents.\n\n6. Indirect Naming:\n - Accept references like \"the title compound\", \"the desired product\", \"the compound obtained in Step 2\" as meaning the current product but do NOT use them as compound_id or iupac_name.\n - Use section titles as compound_id only when rules above apply.\n\n7. Multiple Steps under One Example:\n - Each step must be separate.\n - Only the final step in the section can take the section title as compound_id.\n - Intermediate steps: assign compound_id as per the above rules.\n"

Your job is to extract **each synthesis step** from chemical patent text, with strict adherence to original structure and wording, and no cross-step inference. Follow the rules below carefully.\n\n---\n\n# Background\n\nThe input consists of patent text converted from PDF, marked with explicit region tags:\n- <text id=page###.id##> … </text>: OCR'd paragraph, sentence, or bullet.\n- <mol id=page###.id##> … </mol>: One molecular structure, with an ID.\n- <table id=page###.id###> … </table>: Markdown-format table data.\n- <scheme id=page###.id##> … </scheme>: Synthesis route image as Markdown table.\n\n**Tags are always top-level, never nested, and maintain page order. All IDs must be preserved exactly as in the source.**\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Task\n\nExtract **every synthesis step** as a separate record (never group multiple steps together), regardless of how compounds or examples are organized in the patent.\nFor each step, extract these fields:\n---\n\n## 1. `compound_id`\n- The identifier of the **final product of this synthesis step** (e.g., \"Compound 2\", \"Intermediate B\").\n- For a sub-step product without an explicit identifier but within a section title, construct the compound_id as:  `[Section Title].[Sub-step Label]`  \n  E.g., \"Example 5.Step 2\" (use original wording for both section and sub-step).\n- If the step **explicitly names** the product (e.g., \"to give Compound 4\", \"affording Intermediate B\"), use that exact label.\n- If this is the **final product-forming step** under a section title (like \"Example 5\", \"Compound 3\", \"Preparation 2\") and the product is not otherwise named, assign the section title as the `compound_id`.\n- Only the last step in such a section may receive the section title as `compound_id`.\n- If the step is not within any titled section and lacks a product identifier, set `compound_id` to \"\".\n\n\n## 2. `iupac_name`\n- The IUPAC name of the product synthesized in this step.\n- If it is explicitly stated in the step heading or text, use it.\n- If not, and this is the final product and referred to as \"the title compound,\" you may use the title IUPAC name if it exist.\n- Otherwise, set to \"\".\n- **Never infer, summarize, or fabricate names based on other steps or reagents.**\n\n## 3. `structure_id`\n- Only assign a structure_id if a <mol> tag is present and represents the final product of the entire Example/Section (not for every intermediate or step product).\n- Most steps will have structure_id: \"\".\n- If a structure drawing is given, link its ID only to the last product-forming step in that Example/Section.\n- Never infer or fabricate a structure_id.\n\n\n## 4. `detail_ids`\n- An ordered list of `<text id=...>` blocks containing the synthesis procedure for this step.\n- Include only blocks describing the actual experimental procedure for this step.\n- Do not include analytical data unless mixed with procedural text.\n- Each ID must point to a complete block.\n\n## 5. `detail`\n- Concatenate, in order, the verbatim text of all blocks listed in `detail_ids`.\n- A thorough and continuous text describing the synthesis steps, conditions, observations, and any relevant analytical data (e.g., NMR, LCMS) for the compound.\n- **No paraphrasing or summarization. Only literal extraction.**\n\n## 6. `refs`\n- A list of compound identifiers (e.g., \"Compound 1\", \"Intermediate A\") referenced as precursors, reagents, or intermediates in this step.\n- Only exact, formal identifiers as found in the text.\n- Never include chemical names, structures, or SMILES.\n- If no previous compounds are referenced, set to `null` (do not use an empty list).\n\n---\n\n# Output Format\n\nWrap all steps in a single JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"compound_id\": \"...\",\n      \"iupac_name\": \"...\",\n      \"structure_id\": \"...\",\n      \"detail_ids\": [\"...\", ...],\n      \"detail\": \"...\",\n      \"refs\": [...] or null\n    },\n    { ... }\n  ]\n}\n```\nField order and structure must be strictly followed.\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Rules\n\n1. One record per synthesis step—even if steps are within a single Example/Compound section.\n\n2. Support all text formats, including:\n  - Compound ID + structure + IUPAC name + procedure\n  - Compound ID + route diagram + multi-step synthesis\n  - Only IUPAC name + procedure\n  - IUPAC name + structure + procedure\n  - Numbered steps within an Example\n  - Long, unsegmented procedural blocks (treat as one step if only one product is described)\n\n3. Never combine steps—always split at clearly marked \"Step\" boundaries or by explicit process transitions.\n\n4. No cross-step inference—never borrow, infer, or synthesize data from other steps or context.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n  - If no explicit step labels, split based on clear process boundaries (e.g., “Then was added…”).\n  - If only a chemical name is present for the product (no identifier), set compound_id to \"\", use the name.\n  - For refs, only include labels for compounds explicitly referenced as reactants, intermediates, or reagents.\n\n6. Indirect Naming:\n - Accept references like \"the title compound\", \"the desired product\", \"the compound obtained in Step 2\" as meaning the current product but do NOT use them as compound_id or iupac_name.\n - Use section titles as compound_id only when rules above apply.\n\n7. Multiple Steps under One Example:\n - Each step must be separate.\n - Only the final step in the section can take the section title as compound_id.\n - Intermediate steps: assign compound_id as per the above rules.\n"

Your job is to extract **each synthesis step** from chemical patent text, with strict adherence to original structure and wording, and no cross-step inference. Follow the rules below carefully.\n\n---\n\n# Background\n\nThe input consists of patent text converted from PDF, marked with explicit region tags:\n- <text id=page###.id##> … </text>: OCR'd paragraph, sentence, or bullet.\n- <mol id=page###.id##> … </mol>: One molecular structure, with an ID.\n- <table id=page###.id###> … </table>: Markdown-format table data.\n- <scheme id=page###.id##> … </scheme>: Synthesis route image as Markdown table.\n\n**Tags are always top-level, never nested, and maintain page order. All IDs must be preserved exactly as in the source.**\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Task\n\nExtract **every synthesis step** as a separate record (never group multiple steps together), regardless of how compounds or examples are organized in the patent.\nFor each step, extract these fields:\n---\n\n## 1. `compound_id`\n- The identifier of the **final product of this synthesis step** (e.g., \"Compound 2\", \"Intermediate B\").\n- For a sub-step product without an explicit identifier but within a section title, construct the compound_id as:  `[Section Title].[Sub-step Label]`  \n  E.g., \"Example 5.Step 2\" (use original wording for both section and sub-step).\n- If the step **explicitly names** the product (e.g., \"to give Compound 4\", \"affording Intermediate B\"), use that exact label.\n- If this is the **final product-forming step** under a section title (like \"Example 5\", \"Compound 3\", \"Preparation 2\") and the product is not otherwise named, assign the section title as the `compound_id`.\n- Only the last step in such a section may receive the section title as `compound_id`.\n- If the step is not within any titled section and lacks a product identifier, set `compound_id` to \"\".\n\n\n## 2. `iupac_name`\n- The IUPAC name of the product synthesized in this step.\n- If it is explicitly stated in the step heading or text, use it.\n- If not, and this is the final product and referred to as \"the title compound,\" you may use the title IUPAC name if it exist.\n- Otherwise, set to \"\".\n- **Never infer, summarize, or fabricate names based on other steps or reagents.**\n\n## 3. `structure_id`\n- Only assign a structure_id if a <mol> tag is present and represents the final product of the entire Example/Section (not for every intermediate or step product).\n- Most steps will have structure_id: \"\".\n- If a structure drawing is given, link its ID only to the last product-forming step in that Example/Section.\n- Never infer or fabricate a structure_id.\n\n\n## 4. `detail_ids`\n- An ordered list of `<text id=...>` blocks containing the synthesis procedure for this step.\n- Include only blocks describing the actual experimental procedure for this step.\n- Do not include analytical data unless mixed with procedural text.\n- Each ID must point to a complete block.\n\n## 5. `detail`\n- Concatenate, in order, the verbatim text of all blocks listed in `detail_ids`.\n- A thorough and continuous text describing the synthesis steps, conditions, observations, and any relevant analytical data (e.g., NMR, LCMS) for the compound.\n- **No paraphrasing or summarization. Only literal extraction.**\n\n## 6. `refs`\n- A list of compound identifiers (e.g., \"Compound 1\", \"Intermediate A\") referenced as precursors, reagents, or intermediates in this step.\n- Only exact, formal identifiers as found in the text.\n- Never include chemical names, structures, or SMILES.\n- If no previous compounds are referenced, set to `null` (do not use an empty list).\n\n---\n\n# Output Format\n\nWrap all steps in a single JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"compound_id\": \"...\",\n      \"iupac_name\": \"...\",\n      \"structure_id\": \"...\",\n      \"detail_ids\": [\"...\", ...],\n      \"detail\": \"...\",\n      \"refs\": [...] or null\n    },\n    { ... }\n  ]\n}\n```\nField order and structure must be strictly followed.\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Rules\n\n1. One record per synthesis step—even if steps are within a single Example/Compound section.\n\n2. Support all text formats, including:\n  - Compound ID + structure + IUPAC name + procedure\n  - Compound ID + route diagram + multi-step synthesis\n  - Only IUPAC name + procedure\n  - IUPAC name + structure + procedure\n  - Numbered steps within an Example\n  - Long, unsegmented procedural blocks (treat as one step if only one product is described)\n\n3. Never combine steps—always split at clearly marked \"Step\" boundaries or by explicit process transitions.\n\n4. No cross-step inference—never borrow, infer, or synthesize data from other steps or context.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n  - If no explicit step labels, split based on clear process boundaries (e.g., “Then was added…”).\n  - If only a chemical name is present for the product (no identifier), set compound_id to \"\", use the name.\n  - For refs, only include labels for compounds explicitly referenced as reactants, intermediates, or reagents.\n\n6. Indirect Naming:\n - Accept references like \"the title compound\", \"the desired product\", \"the compound obtained in Step 2\" as meaning the current product but do NOT use them as compound_id or iupac_name.\n - Use section titles as compound_id only when rules above apply.\n\n7. Multiple Steps under One Example:\n - Each step must be separate.\n - Only the final step in the section can take the section title as compound_id.\n - Intermediate steps: assign compound_id as per the above rules.\n"

Your job is to extract **each synthesis step** from chemical patent text, with strict adherence to original structure and wording, and no cross-step inference. Follow the rules below carefully.\n\n---\n\n# Background\n\nThe input consists of patent text converted from PDF, marked with explicit region tags:\n- <text id=page###.id##> … </text>: OCR'd paragraph, sentence, or bullet.\n- <mol id=page###.id##> … </mol>: One molecular structure, with an ID.\n- <table id=page###.id###> … </table>: Markdown-format table data.\n- <scheme id=page###.id##> … </scheme>: Synthesis route image as Markdown table.\n\n**Tags are always top-level, never nested, and maintain page order. All IDs must be preserved exactly as in the source.**\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Task\n\nExtract **every synthesis step** as a separate record (never group multiple steps together), regardless of how compounds or examples are organized in the patent.\nFor each step, extract these fields:\n---\n\n## 1. `compound_id`\n- The identifier of the **final product of this synthesis step** (e.g., \"Compound 2\", \"Intermediate B\").\n- For a sub-step product without an explicit identifier but within a section title, construct the compound_id as:  `[Section Title].[Sub-step Label]`  \n  E.g., \"Example 5.Step 2\" (use original wording for both section and sub-step).\n- If the step **explicitly names** the product (e.g., \"to give Compound 4\", \"affording Intermediate B\"), use that exact label.\n- If this is the **final product-forming step** under a section title (like \"Example 5\", \"Compound 3\", \"Preparation 2\") and the product is not otherwise named, assign the section title as the `compound_id`.\n- Only the last step in such a section may receive the section title as `compound_id`.\n- If the step is not within any titled section and lacks a product identifier, set `compound_id` to \"\".\n\n\n## 2. `iupac_name`\n- The IUPAC name of the product synthesized in this step.\n- If it is explicitly stated in the step heading or text, use it.\n- If not, and this is the final product and referred to as \"the title compound,\" you may use the title IUPAC name if it exist.\n- Otherwise, set to \"\".\n- **Never infer, summarize, or fabricate names based on other steps or reagents.**\n\n## 3. `structure_id`\n- Only assign a structure_id if a <mol> tag is present and represents the final product of the entire Example/Section (not for every intermediate or step product).\n- Most steps will have structure_id: \"\".\n- If a structure drawing is given, link its ID only to the last product-forming step in that Example/Section.\n- Never infer or fabricate a structure_id.\n\n\n## 4. `detail_ids`\n- An ordered list of `<text id=...>` blocks containing the synthesis procedure for this step.\n- Include only blocks describing the actual experimental procedure for this step.\n- Do not include analytical data unless mixed with procedural text.\n- Each ID must point to a complete block.\n\n## 5. `detail`\n- Concatenate, in order, the verbatim text of all blocks listed in `detail_ids`.\n- A thorough and continuous text describing the synthesis steps, conditions, observations, and any relevant analytical data (e.g., NMR, LCMS) for the compound.\n- **No paraphrasing or summarization. Only literal extraction.**\n\n## 6. `refs`\n- A list of compound identifiers (e.g., \"Compound 1\", \"Intermediate A\") referenced as precursors, reagents, or intermediates in this step.\n- Only exact, formal identifiers as found in the text.\n- Never include chemical names, structures, or SMILES.\n- If no previous compounds are referenced, set to `null` (do not use an empty list).\n\n---\n\n# Output Format\n\nWrap all steps in a single JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"compound_id\": \"...\",\n      \"iupac_name\": \"...\",\n      \"structure_id\": \"...\",\n      \"detail_ids\": [\"...\", ...],\n      \"detail\": \"...\",\n      \"refs\": [...] or null\n    },\n    { ... }\n  ]\n}\n```\nField order and structure must be strictly followed.\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Rules\n\n1. One record per synthesis step—even if steps are within a single Example/Compound section.\n\n2. Support all text formats, including:\n  - Compound ID + structure + IUPAC name + procedure\n  - Compound ID + route diagram + multi-step synthesis\n  - Only IUPAC name + procedure\n  - IUPAC name + structure + procedure\n  - Numbered steps within an Example\n  - Long, unsegmented procedural blocks (treat as one step if only one product is described)\n\n3. Never combine steps—always split at clearly marked \"Step\" boundaries or by explicit process transitions.\n\n4. No cross-step inference—never borrow, infer, or synthesize data from other steps or context.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n  - If no explicit step labels, split based on clear process boundaries (e.g., “Then was added…”).\n  - If only a chemical name is present for the product (no identifier), set compound_id to \"\", use the name.\n  - For refs, only include labels for compounds explicitly referenced as reactants, intermediates, or reagents.\n\n6. Indirect Naming:\n - Accept references like \"the title compound\", \"the desired product\", \"the compound obtained in Step 2\" as meaning the current product but do NOT use them as compound_id or iupac_name.\n - Use section titles as compound_id only when rules above apply.\n\n7. Multiple Steps under One Example:\n - Each step must be separate.\n - Only the final step in the section can take the section title as compound_id.\n - Intermediate steps: assign compound_id as per the above rules.\n"

Your job is to extract **each synthesis step** from chemical patent text, with strict adherence to original structure and wording, and no cross-step inference. Follow the rules below carefully.\n\n---\n\n# Background\n\nThe input consists of patent text converted from PDF, marked with explicit region tags:\n- <text id=page###.id##> … </text>: OCR'd paragraph, sentence, or bullet.\n- <mol id=page###.id##> … </mol>: One molecular structure, with an ID.\n- <table id=page###.id###> … </table>: Markdown-format table data.\n- <scheme id=page###.id##> … </scheme>: Synthesis route image as Markdown table.\n\n**Tags are always top-level, never nested, and maintain page order. All IDs must be preserved exactly as in the source.**\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Task\n\nExtract **every synthesis step** as a separate record (never group multiple steps together), regardless of how compounds or examples are organized in the patent.\nFor each step, extract these fields:\n---\n\n## 1. `compound_id`\n- The identifier of the **final product of this synthesis step** (e.g., \"Compound 2\", \"Intermediate B\").\n- For a sub-step product without an explicit identifier but within a section title, construct the compound_id as:  `[Section Title].[Sub-step Label]`  \n  E.g., \"Example 5.Step 2\" (use original wording for both section and sub-step).\n- If the step **explicitly names** the product (e.g., \"to give Compound 4\", \"affording Intermediate B\"), use that exact label.\n- If this is the **final product-forming step** under a section title (like \"Example 5\", \"Compound 3\", \"Preparation 2\") and the product is not otherwise named, assign the section title as the `compound_id`.\n- Only the last step in such a section may receive the section title as `compound_id`.\n- If the step is not within any titled section and lacks a product identifier, set `compound_id` to \"\".\n\n\n## 2. `iupac_name`\n- The IUPAC name of the product synthesized in this step.\n- If it is explicitly stated in the step heading or text, use it.\n- If not, and this is the final product and referred to as \"the title compound,\" you may use the title IUPAC name if it exist.\n- Otherwise, set to \"\".\n- **Never infer, summarize, or fabricate names based on other steps or reagents.**\n\n## 3. `structure_id`\n- Only assign a structure_id if a <mol> tag is present and represents the final product of the entire Example/Section (not for every intermediate or step product).\n- Most steps will have structure_id: \"\".\n- If a structure drawing is given, link its ID only to the last product-forming step in that Example/Section.\n- Never infer or fabricate a structure_id.\n\n\n## 4. `detail_ids`\n- An ordered list of `<text id=...>` blocks containing the synthesis procedure for this step.\n- Include only blocks describing the actual experimental procedure for this step.\n- Do not include analytical data unless mixed with procedural text.\n- Each ID must point to a complete block.\n\n## 5. `detail`\n- Concatenate, in order, the verbatim text of all blocks listed in `detail_ids`.\n- A thorough and continuous text describing the synthesis steps, conditions, observations, and any relevant analytical data (e.g., NMR, LCMS) for the compound.\n- **No paraphrasing or summarization. Only literal extraction.**\n\n## 6. `refs`\n- A list of compound identifiers (e.g., \"Compound 1\", \"Intermediate A\") referenced as precursors, reagents, or intermediates in this step.\n- Only exact, formal identifiers as found in the text.\n- Never include chemical names, structures, or SMILES.\n- If no previous compounds are referenced, set to `null` (do not use an empty list).\n\n---\n\n# Output Format\n\nWrap all steps in a single JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"compound_id\": \"...\",\n      \"iupac_name\": \"...\",\n      \"structure_id\": \"...\",\n      \"detail_ids\": [\"...\", ...],\n      \"detail\": \"...\",\n      \"refs\": [...] or null\n    },\n    { ... }\n  ]\n}\n```\nField order and structure must be strictly followed.\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Rules\n\n1. One record per synthesis step—even if steps are within a single Example/Compound section.\n\n2. Support all text formats, including:\n  - Compound ID + structure + IUPAC name + procedure\n  - Compound ID + route diagram + multi-step synthesis\n  - Only IUPAC name + procedure\n  - IUPAC name + structure + procedure\n  - Numbered steps within an Example\n  - Long, unsegmented procedural blocks (treat as one step if only one product is described)\n\n3. Never combine steps—always split at clearly marked \"Step\" boundaries or by explicit process transitions.\n\n4. No cross-step inference—never borrow, infer, or synthesize data from other steps or context.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n  - If no explicit step labels, split based on clear process boundaries (e.g., “Then was added…”).\n  - If only a chemical name is present for the product (no identifier), set compound_id to \"\", use the name.\n  - For refs, only include labels for compounds explicitly referenced as reactants, intermediates, or reagents.\n\n6. Indirect Naming:\n - Accept references like \"the title compound\", \"the desired product\", \"the compound obtained in Step 2\" as meaning the current product but do NOT use them as compound_id or iupac_name.\n - Use section titles as compound_id only when rules above apply.\n\n7. Multiple Steps under One Example:\n - Each step must be separate.\n - Only the final step in the section can take the section title as compound_id.\n - Intermediate steps: assign compound_id as per the above rules.\n"

Your job is to extract **each synthesis step** from chemical patent text, with strict adherence to original structure and wording, and no cross-step inference. Follow the rules below carefully.\n\n---\n\n# Background\n\nThe input consists of patent text converted from PDF, marked with explicit region tags:\n- <text id=page###.id##> … </text>: OCR'd paragraph, sentence, or bullet.\n- <mol id=page###.id##> … </mol>: One molecular structure, with an ID.\n- <table id=page###.id###> … </table>: Markdown-format table data.\n- <scheme id=page###.id##> … </scheme>: Synthesis route image as Markdown table.\n\n**Tags are always top-level, never nested, and maintain page order. All IDs must be preserved exactly as in the source.**\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Task\n\nExtract **every synthesis step** as a separate record (never group multiple steps together), regardless of how compounds or examples are organized in the patent.\nFor each step, extract these fields:\n---\n\n## 1. `compound_id`\n- The identifier of the **final product of this synthesis step** (e.g., \"Compound 2\", \"Intermediate B\").\n- For a sub-step product without an explicit identifier but within a section title, construct the compound_id as:  `[Section Title].[Sub-step Label]`  \n  E.g., \"Example 5.Step 2\" (use original wording for both section and sub-step).\n- If the step **explicitly names** the product (e.g., \"to give Compound 4\", \"affording Intermediate B\"), use that exact label.\n- If this is the **final product-forming step** under a section title (like \"Example 5\", \"Compound 3\", \"Preparation 2\") and the product is not otherwise named, assign the section title as the `compound_id`.\n- Only the last step in such a section may receive the section title as `compound_id`.\n- If the step is not within any titled section and lacks a product identifier, set `compound_id` to \"\".\n\n\n## 2. `iupac_name`\n- The IUPAC name of the product synthesized in this step.\n- If it is explicitly stated in the step heading or text, use it.\n- If not, and this is the final product and referred to as \"the title compound,\" you may use the title IUPAC name if it exist.\n- Otherwise, set to \"\".\n- **Never infer, summarize, or fabricate names based on other steps or reagents.**\n\n## 3. `structure_id`\n- Only assign a structure_id if a <mol> tag is present and represents the final product of the entire Example/Section (not for every intermediate or step product).\n- Most steps will have structure_id: \"\".\n- If a structure drawing is given, link its ID only to the last product-forming step in that Example/Section.\n- Never infer or fabricate a structure_id.\n\n\n## 4. `detail_ids`\n- An ordered list of `<text id=...>` blocks containing the synthesis procedure for this step.\n- Include only blocks describing the actual experimental procedure for this step.\n- Do not include analytical data unless mixed with procedural text.\n- Each ID must point to a complete block.\n\n## 5. `detail`\n- Concatenate, in order, the verbatim text of all blocks listed in `detail_ids`.\n- A thorough and continuous text describing the synthesis steps, conditions, observations, and any relevant analytical data (e.g., NMR, LCMS) for the compound.\n- **No paraphrasing or summarization. Only literal extraction.**\n\n## 6. `refs`\n- A list of compound identifiers (e.g., \"Compound 1\", \"Intermediate A\") referenced as precursors, reagents, or intermediates in this step.\n- Only exact, formal identifiers as found in the text.\n- Never include chemical names, structures, or SMILES.\n- If no previous compounds are referenced, set to `null` (do not use an empty list).\n\n---\n\n# Output Format\n\nWrap all steps in a single JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"compound_id\": \"...\",\n      \"iupac_name\": \"...\",\n      \"structure_id\": \"...\",\n      \"detail_ids\": [\"...\", ...],\n      \"detail\": \"...\",\n      \"refs\": [...] or null\n    },\n    { ... }\n  ]\n}\n```\nField order and structure must be strictly followed.\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Rules\n\n1. One record per synthesis step—even if steps are within a single Example/Compound section.\n\n2. Support all text formats, including:\n  - Compound ID + structure + IUPAC name + procedure\n  - Compound ID + route diagram + multi-step synthesis\n  - Only IUPAC name + procedure\n  - IUPAC name + structure + procedure\n  - Numbered steps within an Example\n  - Long, unsegmented procedural blocks (treat as one step if only one product is described)\n\n3. Never combine steps—always split at clearly marked \"Step\" boundaries or by explicit process transitions.\n\n4. No cross-step inference—never borrow, infer, or synthesize data from other steps or context.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n  - If no explicit step labels, split based on clear process boundaries (e.g., “Then was added…”).\n  - If only a chemical name is present for the product (no identifier), set compound_id to \"\", use the name.\n  - For refs, only include labels for compounds explicitly referenced as reactants, intermediates, or reagents.\n\n6. Indirect Naming:\n - Accept references like \"the title compound\", \"the desired product\", \"the compound obtained in Step 2\" as meaning the current product but do NOT use them as compound_id or iupac_name.\n - Use section titles as compound_id only when rules above apply.\n\n7. Multiple Steps under One Example:\n - Each step must be separate.\n - Only the final step in the section can take the section title as compound_id.\n - Intermediate steps: assign compound_id as per the above rules.\n"

Your job is to extract **each synthesis step** from chemical patent text, with strict adherence to original structure and wording, and no cross-step inference. Follow the rules below carefully.\n\n---\n\n# Background\n\nThe input consists of patent text converted from PDF, marked with explicit region tags:\n- <text id=page###.id##> … </text>: OCR'd paragraph, sentence, or bullet.\n- <mol id=page###.id##> … </mol>: One molecular structure, with an ID.\n- <table id=page###.id###> … </table>: Markdown-format table data.\n- <scheme id=page###.id##> … </scheme>: Synthesis route image as Markdown table.\n\n**Tags are always top-level, never nested, and maintain page order. All IDs must be preserved exactly as in the source.**\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Task\n\nExtract **every synthesis step** as a separate record (never group multiple steps together), regardless of how compounds or examples are organized in the patent.\nFor each step, extract these fields:\n---\n\n## 1. `compound_id`\n- The identifier of the **final product of this synthesis step** (e.g., \"Compound 2\", \"Intermediate B\").\n- For a sub-step product without an explicit identifier but within a section title, construct the compound_id as:  `[Section Title].[Sub-step Label]`  \n  E.g., \"Example 5.Step 2\" (use original wording for both section and sub-step).\n- If the step **explicitly names** the product (e.g., \"to give Compound 4\", \"affording Intermediate B\"), use that exact label.\n- If this is the **final product-forming step** under a section title (like \"Example 5\", \"Compound 3\", \"Preparation 2\") and the product is not otherwise named, assign the section title as the `compound_id`.\n- Only the last step in such a section may receive the section title as `compound_id`.\n- If the step is not within any titled section and lacks a product identifier, set `compound_id` to \"\".\n\n\n## 2. `iupac_name`\n- The IUPAC name of the product synthesized in this step.\n- If it is explicitly stated in the step heading or text, use it.\n- If not, and this is the final product and referred to as \"the title compound,\" you may use the title IUPAC name if it exist.\n- Otherwise, set to \"\".\n- **Never infer, summarize, or fabricate names based on other steps or reagents.**\n\n## 3. `structure_id`\n- Only assign a structure_id if a <mol> tag is present and represents the final product of the entire Example/Section (not for every intermediate or step product).\n- Most steps will have structure_id: \"\".\n- If a structure drawing is given, link its ID only to the last product-forming step in that Example/Section.\n- Never infer or fabricate a structure_id.\n\n\n## 4. `detail_ids`\n- An ordered list of `<text id=...>` blocks containing the synthesis procedure for this step.\n- Include only blocks describing the actual experimental procedure for this step.\n- Do not include analytical data unless mixed with procedural text.\n- Each ID must point to a complete block.\n\n## 5. `detail`\n- Concatenate, in order, the verbatim text of all blocks listed in `detail_ids`.\n- A thorough and continuous text describing the synthesis steps, conditions, observations, and any relevant analytical data (e.g., NMR, LCMS) for the compound.\n- **No paraphrasing or summarization. Only literal extraction.**\n\n## 6. `refs`\n- A list of compound identifiers (e.g., \"Compound 1\", \"Intermediate A\") referenced as precursors, reagents, or intermediates in this step.\n- Only exact, formal identifiers as found in the text.\n- Never include chemical names, structures, or SMILES.\n- If no previous compounds are referenced, set to `null` (do not use an empty list).\n\n---\n\n# Output Format\n\nWrap all steps in a single JSON object as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"compound_id\": \"...\",\n      \"iupac_name\": \"...\",\n      \"structure_id\": \"...\",\n      \"detail_ids\": [\"...\", ...],\n      \"detail\": \"...\",\n      \"refs\": [...] or null\n    },\n    { ... }\n  ]\n}\n```\nField order and structure must be strictly followed.\n\n---\n\n# Extraction Rules\n\n1. One record per synthesis step—even if steps are within a single Example/Compound section.\n\n2. Support all text formats, including:\n  - Compound ID + structure + IUPAC name + procedure\n  - Compound ID + route diagram + multi-step synthesis\n  - Only IUPAC name + procedure\n  - IUPAC name + structure + procedure\n  - Numbered steps within an Example\n  - Long, unsegmented procedural blocks (treat as one step if only one product is described)\n\n3. Never combine steps—always split at clearly marked \"Step\" boundaries or by explicit process transitions.\n\n4. No cross-step inference—never borrow, infer, or synthesize data from other steps or context.\n\n5. Edge Cases:\n  - If no explicit step labels, split based on clear process boundaries (e.g., “Then was added…”).\n  - If only a chemical name is present for the product (no identifier), set compound_id to \"\", use the name.\n  - For refs, only include labels for compounds explicitly referenced as reactants, intermediates, or reagents.\n\n6. Indirect Naming:\n - Accept references like \"the title compound\", \"the desired product\", \"the compound obtained in Step 2\" as meaning the current product but do NOT use them as compound_id or iupac_name.\n - Use section titles as compound_id only when rules above apply.\n\n7. Multiple Steps under One Example:\n - Each step must be separate.\n - Only the final step in the section can take the section title as compound_id.\n - Intermediate steps: assign compound_id as per the above rules.\n"
